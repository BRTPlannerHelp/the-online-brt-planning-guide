> Mix a little foolishness with your serious plans; it’s lovely to be silly at the right moment.

With a fully developed document in place, the next step is implementation. Effective marketing involves identifying the best channels for communication, such as direct outreach, print, radio, television news and advertising, and social media. These tools, which are discussed more extensively in Chapter 9: Strategic Planning and Communications and Chapter 10: Public Participation, should be integrated into a comprehensive marketing campaign strategy that reaches different constituencies with targeted messages.

At the outset, the implementation strategy will likely focus on educating users about the new system and entice users to give it a try. At later stages, the strategy may play upon the initial successes, learn from mistakes, and target groups that may lag behind in terms of usage, such as motorists. It is important to remember that all the best technical planning can be undone if the system is not presented appropriately to the general public. The remainder of this chapter will cover the (very) basics of a marketing campaign, which is, essentially, the introduction of the brand to the public.
